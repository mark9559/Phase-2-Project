## Project Description

   For this project, I am going to build a Sneaker Shop Management System.My frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and React JS and will communicate with a public API.
   The Sneaker Shop Management System is a single page web application designed to efficiently manage the operations of a sneaker store. It provides the necessary features for both the customers and the store owners to interact with the sneaker inventory and perform various actions. This system aims to streamline the process of managing and purchasing sneakers, making it a user-friendly and efficient experience.

   Key Features:

   1. Product Management:

     Create, Read, Update, and Delete sneaker products.Store owners can easily add, modify, or remove sneakers from the inventory through a user-friendly interface.

   2. Product Listing:

     Display a list of available sneakers.Sneaker products are organized and showcased in an organized catalog, making it simple for customers to browse through the inventory.

   3. Product Details:

     Allow users to view details of individual sneakers.
     Customers can access comprehensive information about each sneaker, including images, descriptions, prices, and available sizes.

   4. Shopping Cart:

     Implement a shopping cart for adding/removing sneakers.Customers can add their desired sneakers to a virtual shopping cart for easy tracking of their selections.

   5. Cart Management:

     Calculate and display the total price of items in the cart.The system computes the total cost of the items in the cart, making it convenient for customers to stay within their budget.

   6. Purchase Simulation:

     Process a simulated purchase (no real payment processing required).Customers can simulate a purchase, and upon confirmation, the system records the order and adjusts the inventory.
